## Concept

This framework and web app aims to support a wide variety of ciphers, formats, algorithms and methods (called 'Bricks') while keeping them easily combinable. There are currently two types of Bricks: Encoders and Viewers. Encoders manipulate content by encoding or decoding in a specific way and using specific settings while Viewers allow users to access and edit the content fed into or outputted by Encoders in a certain way and format.

Bricks can be arranged inside a Pipe. When the content gets edited inside a Viewer or when Brick settings get changed, the result propagates through the Pipe's Bricks in order and in both directions.

Chain objects encapsulate UTF-8 text or binary based content exchanged between Bricks. They automatically encode or decode the content when combining a text based output with a binary based input and vice-versa.
